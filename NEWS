- Alois Schloegl takes the role as maintainer of the bioinfo package.
    As discussed, this package will be maintained under a coding
    style that is compatible to Octave AND Matlab. Both, Octave
    and Matlab, are target platforms. If the code does not run
    correctly on any of the target platforms, it is considered a bug.
